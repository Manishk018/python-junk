Region>AZ>
CloudFront:Setup Infra as per xml or yaml, spins ec2,db,s3,ML, multiple acc and region

Well Arch framework(pillars)
	- Operational Excellence:Running and monitoring systems, responding to events, define standards
	- Security:protecting information and system.
	- Reliability:workloads and quick recovery from failures. adapting to change req.
	- Performance Efficency:structured and streamlined allocation of resources. monitoring
	- Cost optimization:avoiding unnecessary cost, scaling without overspending.
	- Sustainibility:minimum env impact on cloud workload, shared responsibility, reduce downstream impact.				

Rout 53
	- Simple:for single resource
	- Failover routing policy – Use when you want to configure active-passive failover. You can use failover routing to create records in a private hosted zone.
	- Geolocation routing policy – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users. You can use geolocation routing to create records in a private hosted zone.
	- Geoproximity routing policy – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and, optionally, shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in another location.
	- Latency routing policy – Use when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic to the Region that provides the best latency. You can use latency routing to create records in a private hosted zone.
	- IP-sed routing policy – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users, and have the IP addresses that the traffic originates from.
	- Multivalue answer routing policy – Use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random. You can use multivalue answer routing to create records in a private hosted zone.
	- Weighted routing policy – Use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify.
